# Scripts

## Bookmarks.sh 

Small script to copy the highlighted text to the lnks bookmark file located in ~/lnks/bookmarks.txt
This will then be used for the lnks management system lnks.
A keybind has been added in ~/.config/sway/config so that leader+Shift+b will call this script and append the link to the bookmarks file.
